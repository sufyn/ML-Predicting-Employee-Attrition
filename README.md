Employee Attrition Prediction - Machine Learning Approach (README.txt)

Project Overview

This repository contains code for predicting employee attrition using machine learning techniques. The project analyzes the IBM HR Employee Attrition & Performance dataset to understand factors influencing employee turnover.

Key Features

Data exploration and visualization.
Preprocessing techniques for handling missing values and categorical features.
Feature scaling (optional).
Class imbalance handling (optional).
Implementation of machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Feature selection using Random Forest importance scores.
Model optimization with GridSearchCV (using Random Forest as an example).
Comprehensive documentation and presentation template.


Requirements

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
imblearn (optional, for class imbalance handling)
joblib


Running the Script

Download the IBM HR Employee Attrition & Performance dataset and place it in the same directory as the script (replace "IBM_HR_Employee_Attrition.csv" with your actual filename).
Run the script: python employee_attrition_prediction.py

Output

The script will generate a report summarizing the analysis, including data exploration findings, model performance results, and insights gained.
Additionally, a presentation template is provided to showcase key steps, visualizations, and conclusions.
The best performing model will be saved as best_model.pkl for future use.
